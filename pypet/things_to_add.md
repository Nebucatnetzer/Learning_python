Some interesting things I could add to the
tamagotchi programme which shouldn't be too hard:

    * ~~create a loop~~
    * ~~give it happines~~
    * give it points for hungriness
    * ~~add the guessing game and increase the happines by one point
    when you finished the game~~
    * ~~create a list with things you can do~~
    * pet it to increase happiness
    * poke it to make it speak, pokes let it loose a happines point
    * add max values depending on the status
    * sleeping with all values with over 50% full heals the pet if it has lost health
    * add pooping and cleaning function
    * let it get sick if it's health is low, by random chance or if there's too much poop
    * let it age
    * decrease the hunger value after x seconds
    * add sleep function, you have to switch the lights off otherwise it will have nightmare and loose one health point.
* add the possibility to get sick. Maybe compare two random numbers.
