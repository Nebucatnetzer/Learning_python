Some interesting things I could add to the
tamagotchi programme which shouldn't be too hard:

    * create a loop
    * give it happines
    * give it points for hungriness
    * add the guessing game and increase the happines by one point
    when you finished the game
    * create a list with things you can do
    * pet it
    * poke it to make it speak
