* adding a function to decrease the health

Time function has to be implemented otherwise the decrease.* functions won't work. 
It seems to work however the import time part has to go into the pet_functions.py file.
Maybe I should move all the imports to that file otherwise it's not clear why they are needed.

Moved all the imports to there relevant place 
And added the time import. Things are working now like intented.
However the pet doesn't get updated automatically. I currently don't know how to achieve that.
I'll have to ask reddit how to do it.
